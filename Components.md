# Lead Responsibilities

A lead might not do all (or even most) development on a component but should

* Help plan the functional and architectural evolution of the component - developing or writing user stories, for example.
* Be responsible for maintenance of the component and repos that aren't for particular stories. That includes updating dependencies, picking up security alerts and creating tags/packages/builds/... when we're making a release.
